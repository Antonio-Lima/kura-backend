## Kura Backend (Go Study Project)

This repository contains a backend project that I started to **learn Go (Golang)** and improve my skills in **backend development**.

The main goals of this project are:
- **Practice Go syntax and standard library**
- **Study backend concepts** such as APIs, routing, data handling, and project structure
- **Experiment with best practices** for clean, maintainable backend code

Feel free to explore the code as it evolves over time. Since this is a study project, the structure and patterns may change as I learn new things.

This project is **not finished** yet. I am **continuously adding new features and functionalities** as I study and try out new backend ideas.
